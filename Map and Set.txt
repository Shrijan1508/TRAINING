*Map and set both are collection of keys but map has values associated with key
*A set is a non-sequenced (no indexes) collection of distinct objects (no duplicates). 
*The presence or not of an object is important.
*A map is a collection of key-value pairs. 
*Each ordered pair contains a key and a value.
